        <p>I’m Puteri, or you can call me Cik Medical Card. I’m here to help you understand and choose the right insurance. From medical cards to full coverage, I’ll guide you in selecting the protection that suits you. My focus is on providing clear and simple advice.</p>
        <p>Navigating the world of insurance can be overwhelming, but I’m here to simplify it for you. As an Allianz Life Changer, I am committed to helping you understand your insurance options and ensure you receive the coverage that truly meets your needs. My journey into this field began with a deeply personal experience—my youngest brother’s severe accident. It was this incident that opened my eyes to the critical importance of having comprehensive insurance and truly understanding the policies we hold. Since then, I’ve made it my mission to help others make informed decisions and gain the peace of mind they deserve.</p>

        <p>Many people I encounter already have insurance, but they don’t fully understand the coverage they’ve purchased. This is where I step in. I take the time to guide my clients through their policies, explaining the details clearly and answering all their questions so they can feel confident about their decisions. Whether it’s your medical card or a broader insurance plan, I make sure you understand the protection you have in place.

          <p>My academic background in anthropology and sociology has helped me develop a deep understanding of human behavior and societal needs. This knowledge allows me to connect with people on a personal level, ensuring that their unique needs are met. I’m not just here to sell policies—I’m here to offer guidance, provide clarity, and build lasting relationships. Whether it’s addressing your immediate concerns or planning for the future, I am dedicated to helping you secure the protection you need.</p>
          <p>Through my partnership with Allianz, I’m proud to offer a range of insurance solutions tailored to you and your family’s needs. I’ll be with you every step of the way, making sure that you and your loved ones are fully protected. My goal is to be a trusted advisor who helps you understand the importance of insurance and guides you toward the best possible coverage.</p>
